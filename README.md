this repository is for my class appm4600.
it is a class called numerical analysis and scientific computing
colloquially it is known as algorithms
i think
I was really excited about this class because id been thinking about
implementing the things i learned in math, in a programming language
i wish we were using c instead of python but that's ok
im not sure what 500 what 500 characters looks like but i hope this is enough
