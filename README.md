this repository is for my numnerical analysis class
from what i understand we are going to mainly be coding up some 
really cool algorithms. so far there are files in here for plotting
figures, multiple fugures on the same plot, changing specific plot colors etc
looking through the book, these are things ive thought about implementing 
in a language for some time, so i was really glad to find out that is the 
purpose of this class.
